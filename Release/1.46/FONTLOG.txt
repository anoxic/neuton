FONTLOG for the Neuton fonts

This file provbides detailed information on the Neuton Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Neuton fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

<p>Neuton is a clean, dark, somewhat Dutch-inspired serif font which reminds you a little of Times. It has a large height, short extenders, and a compact width for better screen use, and economy of space.</p> <p>The family will comprise a regular, italic, and cursive, each in five weights and with smallcaps. Two italics — one will be called "italic", and the other "cursive" — are uncommon, but very useful. Ever tried emphasizing something already emphasized? Beyond that obvious example, there are other uses.</p> <p>Sometimes a text needs a different flavor or feel. While one roman can work for a variety of texts, the companion italics don't always. In more classical or personal documents, a stiff, sober, modern and down-to-earth italic will never work. And in many essays, some of the fancier italics look ridiculous. Who said a roman needs only one companion?</p>

Neuton is in continuing development and will come to have:
- 5 weights, from Extralight to Extrabold
- Italic and Smallcaps versions
- A cursive variant
- Extended width versions
