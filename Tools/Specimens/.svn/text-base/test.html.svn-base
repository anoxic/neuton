		<h1>I Pause</h1>
		<pre>
Climbing up the knotted cedar
Moleskin between my teeth
No branches near the earth to grab
But the knots will work beneath

The first branch I reach is so broken
I pause in thought
The next I grab with a motion
I climb and nestle into my spot

Up near the top,
A branch for my back
One for my seat
A small one for my feet

Opening rich white pages of my journal
Pica grid blue and thin
I pull the pen from my pocket, and then
I unblur the lines of my thoughts
Til all of them are caught
And the bleeding edge is made naught
		</pre>

		<h1>Stone</h1>
<pre>I've looked about and thought today
How the world has turned
      From black and white to gray
Over a thousand days
A thousand waves
Into the depths of the darkest caves
You'll find out,
      Everything has always been the same
There is no new thing under the sun
Even for philosophers on a hill
But for them, even them,
      Love can spill
And overflow with forgiveness

This day I pray
You'll seek what I know
I loved you so much
I think that you know
But you've been taken with a foul blow
Don't let your heart sit in that snow
Of stone

Cry, deep tears of sorrow
For the lost and alone
When they die they wont be home
Don't be that way I pray

The world melts
Black and white turns to gray

<div style="-moz-transform: rotate(-3deg); -o-transform: rotate(-3deg); -webkit-transform: rotate(-3deg);">That you can take with marvellous infusion
Making your thoughts lost in the room of smoke
And when you inhale, you choke</div>

To make my doubts go aloof

		<h1>Pack Rat</h1>
		<pre>
I pool the wool over my eyes
It takes me days and days to realize
Away in my mind, like a rat,
      My thoughts I pack
They'll be falling like a freight train
      From a track

So to keep from crashing I'll extract
My thoughts into a list so exact

I forget the words I'm writing down
(Fumbling like a sad, sad clown)
Even with the lessons learned
My mind ends up burnt
What I try doesn't tend to work

		<h1>Rest Ye Weary</h1>
		<pre>
Though my arms and legs may be broken
I'll always be outspoken
About a man that lived long ago
So to Heaven we can go

Naked and ye clothed me
Sick and ye visited me
In prison, and ye came to me.

Such words we wish to hear.
If not I'd wish to disappear

About my clothes I should not worry
To make some money, I will not hurry

Seek ye first the Kingdom of God
And it's righteousness
And all shall be added unto you

More important than my stew
Is the words upon which we should chew

The inspired word of Him
To read it go as far as a limb
It's more powerful than you
So read it you should do

I speak these words in love
Don't take me as your boss
It's just a little shove
I don't want you
       into flames tossed


Listen to His words for rest ye Weary
It's fact, not fiction or theory

		<h1>Bright and Shining</h1>
		<pre>
Give her a hedge of protection
While I try to reach perfection
I'll prepare for her a place one day
So don't let her be lead astray
Please let me appropriate
Everything so she wont have to wait

I'm not that far
Oh bright and shining star
I want to lead
Don't let that be construed as greed

I'm kinda tired but I'm trying very hard
I've made mistakes but I hope my record's not marred
I know I'll lead you as we start a family
But I can't help it if we can't yet be

I don't know you, at least not for sure
That's the truth, it's not some kind of lure

I want to sleep, but I've got so much to do
My head aches
And my heart's the same for sure

Lord protect her with Your hedge
While I try to wedge
Myself away from the ledge
And get to where you need me to be
