A classy blend of simplification, curvature, and angles. Neuton, when completed, will comprise 60 fonts: 5 weights, with a Regular, Italic, Cursive, extended widths, and smallcaps for each. Neuton is a healthy modern alternative to Times.

Neuton is intended to be a workhorse textface with a range of variants that will alow it to work in the most complicated editorial enviroments, but also work under the rigorous conditions a web font must endure. It's a marathon runner at text sizes, but it has the detail to be smart and proffesional at large sizes.

Neuton Italic is elegant yet strong, intended to work in serious situations. The additional italic—Neuton Cursive—gives a more bookish and mannered flavor. In addition to this, the two italics can be used together to for double emphasis.
